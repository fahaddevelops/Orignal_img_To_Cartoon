# Image Cartoonization Project

Transform your images into captivating cartoons using the Image Cartoonization Project. This project showcases the utilization of OpenCV for applying various image processing techniques to achieve the cartoon effect.

## Overview

The Image Cartoonization Project demonstrates the process of converting regular images into cartoon-style images through the use of edge detection, color quantization, and noise reduction techniques. The project provides an interactive way to visualize the transition from a simple photo to a charming cartoon-like representation.

## Features

- Convert standard images into artistic cartoon-style renditions.
- Fine-tune the cartoonization level by adjusting parameters.
- Easily observe the transformation with side-by-side image comparison.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-cartoonization.git
   cd image-cartoonization
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your input image in the `resources` directory.
2. Execute the `cartoonize.py` script:

   ```bash
   python cartoonize.py --input resources/your_image.jpg
   ```

3. The resulting cartoonized image will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Examples

Here are some examples of original images alongside their corresponding cartoonized versions:

| Original Image                | Cartoonized Image            |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![Original](examples/cat.jpg) | ![Cartoonized](examples/cartoonized_cat.jpg) |

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

Make sure to replace placeholders (`yourusername`, `your_image.jpg`, etc.) with relevant information from your project. Include example images (`examples/cat.jpg`, `examples/cartoonized_cat.jpg`) and the necessary dependencies.

You can create the `demo.png` file to visually demonstrate the before-and-after transformation. This README template should effectively introduce your project, guide users on how to set up and use it, provide visual examples, and present licensing information.
